/**
 * <pre>
* problem
*
* 1.  1st thread fetches the value of count. (Currently value count is 0) and increases it by one, so value of variable count becomes 1.
* 2.  Now 2nd thread accesses the value of count that would be 0 as 1st thread did not store it back to its location.
* And 2nd thread also increment it and store it back to its location. And 1st also store it.
* 3.Finally value of variable count is 1. But it should be 2 by the effect of both threads. Thatâ€™s why we need to synchronize the access to shared variable count.
 *
